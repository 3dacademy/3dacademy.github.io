  2 evenings per week Â¦ 3 months
---

This is the right workshop if you want to get deeper into the 3D apparel knowledge and for workers. This class will start from the very basic concepts and fundamental of 2D and 3D going through all the different aspects for modelling. In three months you will master all the tools you need to create your desired projects from scratch.
<br>
<br>
Colouring, textures and logos will have no longer secrets for you. You will learn more about the different fabrics behaviour with gravity stitch tension.
<br>
<br>
This is the perfect solution for those who already work in the apparel industry but want to specialize in 3D. Designers, Technicians and pattern makers are the common profiles this course is tailored on.
<br>
<br>
At the end of the course you will be able to realise your 3D models as well as get some interesting material to help you navigate through the 3D world.
