This is the right workshop if you want to improve your already existent 3D skills or if you have already attended the 3D Fast basic. In this workshop you will learn how to deal with different aspects of advanced modelling like pinces, pleats, shrinks.
<br>
<br>
Colouring, textures and logos will have no longer secrets for you. You will learn more about the different fabrics behaviour with gravity stitch tension. On top of it you will get tips on the rendering steps.
<br>
<br>
At the end of the course you will be able to realise your 3D models as well as get some interesting material to help you navigate through the 3D world.
