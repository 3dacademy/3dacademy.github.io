This is the workshop for those who want to get great skills in a short time. It is the best way to start if you donâ€™t have enough time but you want to be ready and productive Monday morning in your office, knowing how to create and modify your 3D projects.
<br>
<br>
Starting from zero, you will be able to create, modify and render your 3D models. This course is the best for Designers but as well for pattern technicians who want to discover the 3D world.
<br>
<br>
At the end of the course you will be able to realise your 3D models as well as get some interesting material to help you navigate through the 3D world.

        During the first day you will get an introduction to the 3D world and its textile usage.
        Then we will go through the setup of the software and get to know the area of work.
        You will learn how to deal with different avatars and how to modify their measurements. Then we will move to the pieces area and their import or creation from scratch. Lastly we will approach the sewing and simulation process.

        During the second day we will dig into the world of colors, texture and trims. You will learn how to color up and import logos 2D and play with 3D objects and trims. Further more we will go in depth into the fabrics properties and their simulation with gravity. We will continue to explore the simulation process, digging into the real time modification and draping.
