This is the workshop for those who want to get great skills in a short time. It is the best way to start if you donâ€™t have enough time but you want to be ready and productive Monday morning in your office, knowing how to create and modify your 3D projects.
<br>
<br>
Starting from zero, you will be able to create, modify and render your 3D models. This course is the best for Designers but as well for pattern technicians who want to discover the 3D world.
<br>
<br>
At the end of the course you will be able to realise your 3D models as well as get some interesting material to help you navigate through the 3D world.
