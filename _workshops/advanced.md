  2 days full immersion advanced level
---

This is the right workshop if you want to improve your already existent 3D skills or if you have already attended the 3D Fast basic. In this workshop you will learn how to deal with different aspects of advanced modelling like pinces, pleats, shrinks.
<br>
<br>
Colouring, textures and logos will have no longer secrets for you. You will learn more about the different fabrics behaviour with gravity stitch tension. On top of it you will get tips on the rendering steps.
<br>
<br>
At the end of the course you will be able to realise your 3D models as well as get some interesting material to help you navigate through the 3D world.

<h3>Please make sure to have the right requirements for this workshop.</h3>

        In the first day you will learn how to deal with different import extensions for both pieces and avatar. Starting from already existent projects we will also go through the advanced modifications tools like pinces, pleats and shrinks. Lately will be the turn of advance trims definition and physical properties.

        During the second day we will approach different simulation conditions as puffiness and furry pieces. Then the second day will be mostly dedicated to the export and render process, which is one of the most important parts for a well done simulation.
        <br>
        There will be an individual exercise to apply everything learned and then time for Q&A.
