    I’m Emanuela, 27 with Italian blood in my veins.
    <br>
    I have a Fashion Design Bachelor degree and I work for the apparel and textile industry since 6 years. I have experience in both fashion and sportswear but, most important, I had the chance to work for a couple of Software house they develop 3D software for the textile. Since I discovered what 3D makes possible in the apparel environment, I just can’t live anymore without.
    <br>
    <br>
    I truly believe this is the tool which can make the fast faster and the big bigger. Unexpectedly the apparel industry is still quite behind the others, when it comes to the technology usage. Finally, we have the tool to make it happen, we just need to make sure more and more people would start have the right expertise on it.
    <br>
